### about the workspace

ls()		# show whats in memory
ls(*object*)	# show contents of object, access those contents with object$content
is(*object*)	# shows type of object	
rm(*object*)  # removes *object* from the workspace
rm(list=ls()) 	#clear memory




### shortcuts
CTRL+R    # run command (Windows)
CMD+ENTER # run command (Mac)
CTRL+L 		# clear console (Windows + Mac)

ALT+N     # ~ on Mac
ALTGR++   #? ~ on Windows




### Initialize variables

vector(,length=4)       # filled with FALSE
matrix(,nrow=4,ncol=5)  # filled with NA




### Debugging

op<- options(error=recover) 	#set on automatic debugger
options(op)			#set off automatic debugger
browser()       #enable debugging during a function

system.time(*one command*)   #to measure how long a comand takes
Sys.Date()	#




### if/else statement vectorized:
varD <- log(0:9)
is.finite(varD)
varD <- ifelse(is.finite(varD), varD, NA)




### Plots

# print plot to pdf:
pdf('mypdf.pdf') 
plot(...)
dev.off()

graphics.off()	#turn off all graphic devices



### Help Search

library(RSiteSearch) # to search all available help pages of contributed package
gar <- RSiteSearch.function('GARCH') # for GARCH
HTML(gar) # to display the results in a web browser

?mean   # for function search
??mean  # for "about" search in locally installed package docs



### Difference between NULL, NA and NaN

a  <-  NULL
a
length(a) # 0
typeof(a) # NULL
is(a)     # "NULL" "OptionalFunction" "optionalMethod"

b  <- NA
b
typeof(b) # logical
is(b)     # "logical" "vector" 

c <- NaN 
c
typeof(c) # double
is(c)     # "numeric" "vector"




### Density vs. CDF 

dnorm gives the density, 				so phi()
pnorm gives the distribution function = cdf,  		so PHI(1.96)=pnorm(1.96)=0.975
qnorm gives the quantile function = inverse cdf, 	so PHI^-1(.975)=qnorm(.975)=1.96
and rnorm generates random deviates.




### Find next friday

nextfri = function(x){
	7 * ceiling(as.numeric(x-5+4) / 7) + as.Date(5-4)
}
	#If x is a vector of class "Date" then nextfri(x) is a vector of the same length with each
	#component replaced by the date of the next Friday. Friday is represented by 5 in the formula 
	#so one can change it to 0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, ..., 6 for Saturday if one wants the
	#weeks to end on some other day of the week.
